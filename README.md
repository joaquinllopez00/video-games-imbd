IVGDb is a site to help people find games that they play, want to play, or just enjoying being in the know about.

With IVGDb I set out to create somewhat of an IMDB clone, but for video games. This project allows users to view upcoming, popular, as well as newly released games. It also allows users to search for titles as well as add games to their library. The project will keep them saved WITHOUT logging in utilizing Redux-Persist. The goal of this project was to get more comfortable with Redux + Redux Persist.
